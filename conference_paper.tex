\begin{abstract}
  Increased photovoltaic (PV) penetration in the low-voltage residential sector highlights the intrinsic problems with Silicon PV (Si-PV) in seasonal power output fluctuations.
  Exploring the potential performance of alternative PV materials, such as Perovskite and Organic in low-light conditions could significantly enhance residential energy systems. 
  In this research, a novel material model is presented to evaluate the performance of Organic PV materials across various temperatures and light conditions. 
  The findings indicate that Low-Light Enhanced PV (LLE-PV) reduces grid energy dependency by 66.37\% in autumn and 22.85\% in winter.
  Consequently, this boosts the self-sufficiency ratios to 0.83 in autumn and 0.39 in winter, in contrast to Si-PV's ratios of 0.59 and 0.21, respectively.
  Additionally, it enabled the transfer of excess energy to the grid during autumn, period significantly affected by solar irradiance variability, an achievement unattainable with Silicon PV.
